This open-source pelvis dataset is constructed to provide clinical pelvic fractures. The atlas is freely available for academic or educational use. For research only.

For each case, preoperative CT was acquired using the Toshiba Aquilion 64-row multi-detector spiral CT scanner.The patients were scanned in the supine position, with the following scanning parameters: tube voltage of 120 kV, current of 125 mAs, slice thickness of 1 mm, matrix size of 512 Ã— 512, and scanning field of 500 mm. The reconstruction was performed using the standard algorithm with a slice thickness and interval of 1 mm and a reconstruction field of 500 mm. 3D models of the bone fragments in ilia and sacrum are obtained by semi-automatic segmentation.

Institutional Review Board Statement: The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Beijing Jishuitan Hospital (202009-04).
